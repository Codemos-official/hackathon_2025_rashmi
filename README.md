Problem Statement

Students face many difficulties while preparing for jobs and internships.
They need resumes, skill-based courses, mentors, mock interviews, and information about off-campus drives.
Currently, these services are available on different platforms, which wastes time and creates confusion.

There is no single platform where students can prepare for careers in a structured and easy way.
